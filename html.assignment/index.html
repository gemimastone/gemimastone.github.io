        <h2> About Me </h2>
<p> 
Hello there!

My name is <b>Gemima Mulune</b>, I am currently a <em>student</em> enrolled in <b>Interactive Media Design</b>,
 prior coming to this program I was enrolled in <b>Medical Esthetics</b>,
  which I <em>successfully graduated</em> from, on June 20<sup>th</sup>, 2020. After that I pursued certifications in different types of services aside from the medical part such as: <b>Eyelash Extension, 
    Microblading, Ombre Brows and Lash Lift</b>.

    <h3> My Goal </h3>
    <p> My dream/goal in life is to be able to <em>own my own private clinic</em> so that I can use the skills I have gained and the passion I have for the Industry into that cause. 
        To support that dream, I reached out to <em>my first passion which is Art</em>; Becoming a UX/UI designer will help me by having a double income to help fund my private clinic.
        The Beauty Industry is expensive equipments wise, therefore it is good to have another source of income while starting out.
         Something that I think would be important for you to know about me is that I describe myself as someone 
        that wants to explore every talent that I have and grow with it to see where it can take me. Every day that I live is one step closer to my destination. 
        I always want more and more, just because I do not want to do the same thing for the rest of my life as there is so much to discover and do in life.
